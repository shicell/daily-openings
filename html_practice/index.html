    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and 
    typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <em>1960s</em> with 
    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,         
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
